// Challenge 1
// Write test cases for next 3 challenges. Also include tests for boundary conditions
// For this challenge, the input will be a (long) string.


// Challenge 2
// A word encountered for the first time is a stranger.
// A word encountered thrice becomes an acquaintance.
// A word encountered 5 times becomes a friend.

// Create a function that takes the string and returns a list of two lists.
// The first is a list of acquaintances in the order they became an acquaintance (see example).
// The second is a list of friends in the order they became a friend.
// Words in the friend list should no longer be in the acquaintance list.

// Example
// noStrangers("See Spot run. See Spot jump. Spot likes jumping. See Spot fly.")
// ➞ [["spot", "see"], []]
/// "see" was encountered first but "spot" became an acquaintance earlier.



// Challenge 3
// Rhyme Time
// Create a function that returns true if two lines rhyme and false otherwise.
// For the purposes of this exercise, two lines rhyme if the last
// word from each sentence contains the same vowels.
// Example:
// doesRhyme("Sam I am!", "Green eggs and ham.") ➞ true


// Challenge 4
// Do All Bigrams (2 character words) Exist?
// You are given an input list of bigrams, and a list of words.
//
// Write a function that returns true if you can find every single bigram from
// this list can be found at least once in an list of words.
//
// Examples
// canFind(["at", "be", "th", "au"], ["beautiful", "the", "hat"]) ➞ true
